#Explanation:

Imagine you and your friend are passing secret notes in class. One of you writes a message, and the other reads and responds. This **Java-Socket-Chat** works the same way but over a computer network! 🖥️💬  

The **server** acts like the teacher’s desk, where messages are exchanged, and **clients** (like students) send and receive messages. Using **Java Sockets**, this project allows real-time chatting between multiple users. It’s a fun way to explore **networking in Java** and how computers communicate! 🚀
